* Qualcomm Technologies Inc. NSS CRYPTO Driver.

This driver is responsible for setting up the ipq807x crypto engine.
The driver is responsible for initialization of crypto engine, downloading
of crypto engine firmware, allocating a dma, setting up context record.

Required properties:
- compatible: "qcom,nss-crypto"
- qcom,max-contexts: Maximum number of supported context
- qcom,max-context-size: Maximum context size in words supported by HW.
- ranges: used when there is a reg_map in child node.

* eip197_node: This is the first child node that denotes that this driver supports eip197 crypto engine.

Required properties:
- compatible: "qcom,eip197".
- reg-names: Indicates various resources passed to driver by name.
- reg: physical address and length of the register set for the device.
- qcom,dma-queue-depth: Max descriptor in a ring
- qcom,dma-mask: Max dma rings supported, each bit represent a ring number
- qcom,transform-enabled: Whether Packet for tranformation will be sent from host or not.
- qcom,aes128-cbc-sha1-hmac: Enable crypto algorithm
- qcom,aes256-cbc-sha1-hmac: Enable crypto algorithm
- qcom,3des-cbc-sha1-hmac: Enable crypto algorithm

* engine0: First engine for EIP197 block. Some crypto HW can support multiple engine.

Required properties:
- reg_offset: offset within the base register for this engine.
- qcom,ifpp-enabled: Enable EIP classification core Firmware.
- qcom,ipue-enabled: Enable EIP classification core Firmware.
- qcom,ofpp-enabled: Enable EIP classification core Firmware.
- qcom,opue-enabled: Enable EIP classification core Firmware.

example:
	qcom,nss_crypto {
		compatible = "qcom,nss-crypto";
		qcom,max-contexts = <16>;
		qcom,max-context-size = <32>;
		ranges;

		eip197_node {
			compatible = "qcom,eip197";
			reg-names = "crypto_pbase";
			reg = <0x39800000 0x7ffff>;
			qcom,dma-queue-depth = <256>;
			qcom,dma-mask = <0xff>;
			qcom,transform-enabled;
			qcom,aes128-cbc-sha1-hmac;
			qcom,aes256-cbc-sha1-hmac;
			qcom,3des-cbc-sha1-hmac;

			engine0 {
				reg_offset = <0x80000>;
				qcom,ifpp-enabled;
				qcom,ipue-enabled;
				qcom,ofpp-enabled;
				qcom,opue-enabled;
			};
		};
	};
